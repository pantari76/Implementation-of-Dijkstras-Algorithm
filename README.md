# Implementation-of-Dijkstras-Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in an undirected graph.
The purpose of this project was for me to better understand the algorithm and implement it recursively. 
Priority queues were not used, and the graph was created through combining objects from different classes.
